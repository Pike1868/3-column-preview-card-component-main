## My process
I picked this challenge to practice layouts with css as I am still struggling with how to layout other projects and websites. I approached this by setting up the html first, trying to be more descriptive with the my class names so that it would help me when working on the css. Once I had that I attempted to do everything with only flex box and was running into a lot of issues. I then decided to brush up on css by taking Kevin Powell's Conquering Responsive Layouts course which really helped me approaching css. After taking this course I learned to breakdown how I tackled my css. I first worked on the colors and fonts and then focused on the layout portion. This really helped me break things down. After that I tackled the layout. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned a lot by tackling this challenge,and took a whole course because I was frustrated when I couldn't figure it out before. I learned that I am good at getting the easier parts of css, like colors and fonts, since they're provided. I still struggled with the layout but after taking the KP's course when I tried different things but I had a bit more understanding of the things I attempted. Adding css grid helped tremendously as I had tried to stay away from it before because I didn't understand it before. I finally arrived at a solution I felt good about but I think it could still be better. If any one would like to take a look at my code and provide any feedback I would greatly appreciate it. Lastly I learned that I still have a long way to go with css but I do feel like I made some progress with this challenge.



### Continued development

Want to keep practicing layouts with flex box and css grid to keep getting better with each challenge.

### Useful resources

  I could not figure this challenge out at first and I realized I needed more help on flex box and css grid. Actually took this course over a few days and then came back to this challenge approaching it with some of the things that I learned. Helped me tackle this mobile first and it helped.
